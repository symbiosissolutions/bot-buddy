# Ask Buddha

## Overview

This React application simulates a conversation with Lord Buddha, providing users with historical and educational information in an engaging format. The chatbot is powered by OpenAI's API, allowing it to generate informative and contextually appropriate responses. To learn more about interacting with the APIs, check out [this doc](./docs/using-the-openai-assistant-apis.md).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool that significantly improves the development experience.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **SWC**: A super-fast compiler that powers the transformation of TypeScript into JavaScript.
